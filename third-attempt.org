* Third attempt

I have installed Haskell Platform again. This time I went to powershell and
executed ~cabal user-config init~ as instructed on Haskell platform website.
Also I added the suggested extra-dirs as the website tells you to do after the
installation.

Next I installed Msys2 from http://www.msys2.org/ and updated it. Later I will
use it for Gtk libraries.
